Hello World!

Just getting into coding and developing. I'm excited to see where this road leads! I started learning HTML and CSS when I was a big Myspace user. Sad to admit that I miss Myspace and my ability to be creative (within Myspace limits and template of course). I remember being SUPER bummed when all my friends switched to Facebook and I realized that there was no opportunity to write my own code and express myself. Just a dumb profile picture (no cover photos then). 

How old am I? 

I'm excited to tap into my almost-forgotten passion (SHOUT OUT to my good friend Clay Cribbs for re-introducing me) for writing code and learning more than just HTML and CSS! The possibilities are endless! How exciting?!
